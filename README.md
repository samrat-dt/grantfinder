## Problem

Starting a business is challenging, with a high failure rate:
- 30% of startups fail within three years.
- 50% fail within five years.
- 70% don’t make it past ten years.

While numerous grants, tax incentives, and support programs exist to assist startups, these resources are:
- Difficult to find.
- Complex to understand.
- Time-consuming to apply for.

This often leads to missed opportunities for startups.

## Solution

Grant Route addresses this problem by providing:
1. A centralized platform to track all relevant grants, tax incentives, and benefits for Indian startups.
2. Personalized recommendations based on the startup’s location, sector, size, and growth stage.
3. Notifications for new and emerging opportunities as they become available.
4. Plans for future automation to streamline the application process.
